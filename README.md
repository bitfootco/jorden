# Jorden
An extremely simple React boilerplate framework designed to provide maximum features for minimal effort. Jorden (Norwegian for "the earth") is an unopinionated toolbox designed to remove initial setup headaches and get you moving quickly with your application.

### Why another React framework?
Not every project needs cutting-edge, application-focused development features or functionality. Sometimes you just need a React app and you just need it to work! Jorden is designed for this use case. It's built to be functional and compact, building React apps that are simple to deploy and a breeze to maintain.
